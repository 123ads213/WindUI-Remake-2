# Remake 2 verification

Build: `1.7.0-remake.1`.

## Preserved original menu

The first provisional demo was rejected because it replaced the old menu with simplified sample controls. **That provisional demo is not the delivered example.** `RemakeExample.lua` is now derived from the complete first-remake example. It retains Search, sidebar Visuals → Player/World, General, Themes, Profile/preferences/history, HUD, color and gradient examples, all original sliders/toggles/inputs/buttons and large/fractional numeric values. New containers change their placement, not their functionality.

Configuration UI is inside the original top window header immediately right of the sidebar/title, not in a separate row below it. Presets has cloud/title, upload, folder-clock/Recent and plus icons; search and sorting are below. All storage remains local.

## Automated checks

- Existing pure tests pass: NumberFormat display/parsing + 2001-point decimal lattice; TabTree12; HotkeyModel22; HUDGeometry31; HUDModel89.
- ConfigNames:22 checks pass (valid/invalid names, basic JSON record validation).
- `luau-compile`: new modules and standalone bundle compile.
- darklua builds `dist/main.lua`; standalone generator builds `dist/remake2.lua`.
- Live client `tests/Remake2.lua`:33 assertions passed on the full restored menu. Actual temporary preset create/save/load/import/export/rename/delete, invalid import rejection, value/dependency persistence, checkmark selection, independent subtabs, narrow/wide layout, preservation of original Profile/HUD/colors/progress examples and trigger containment inside original header.
- Live theme race check: selecting a tab while switching Ocean → Light yielded `TabTitle=17212d` and active background `dde7f6`, matching Light. Creator now cancels old per-property theme tweens, preventing stale Ocean/white text from overwriting newly applied colors.

## Visual inspection

Actual Roblox OS screenshots inspected, not generated mockups:
- Dark Player: ruler/wallet title icons, original numeric values, two-column cards and retained sidebar/profile.
- Light Themes + header presets: readable inactive tabs, correct header placement, reference icon order, nearby popover and soft shadow. `presets-light.jpg`.
- Dark General: original watermark/keylist settings, field selector, behavior and advanced numeric examples. `general-dark.jpg`.
- Compact dropdown: nearby checked single-select popup inspected in the first integration pass; current implementation retains the same popup component.

Limitations are explicit in API.md: no fake cloud service; Recent is modified-order local presets, not version backups; unflagged arbitrary state is not serialized; file writes are not crash-atomic; external callback side effects cannot be rolled back.
